## usage

The main module is ``barf.biased_rf.BiasedRandomForest`` and the user can initialize the estimator with the following main parameters:

- ``p_critical`` : Size of the critial sample set relative to the full data set. Defaults to 0.5.
- ``k_nearest_neighbor``: number of neighbors (from a member of the minor label set) 
            to use (in the critical sample set) from the major label set. Defaults to 10.
- ``n_estimators``: total number of trees to use. Defaults to 100.

e.g.:

        model = BiasedRandomForest(p_critical=0.4, k_nearest_neighbor=15, n_estimators=200)
